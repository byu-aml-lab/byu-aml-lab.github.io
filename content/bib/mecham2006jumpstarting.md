   abstract={Phylogenetic analysis is a central tool in studies of comparative
genomics. When a new region of DNA is isolated and sequenced, researchers
are often forced to throw away months of computation on an existing
phylogeny of homologous sequences in order to incorporate this new sequence.
The previously constructed trees are often discarded, and the researcher begins
the search again from scratch. The jumpstarting algorithm uses trees from the
prior search as a starting point for a new phylogenetic search. This technique
drastically decreases search time for large data sets. This kind of analysis is
necessary as researchers analyse tree of life size data sets.},
