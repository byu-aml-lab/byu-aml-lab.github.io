abstract = "Abstract Topic modeling is a common tool for understanding large bodies of text, but is typically provided as a “take it or leave it” proposition. Incorporating human knowledge in unsupervised learning is a promising approach to create high-quality topic models. Existing interactive systems and modeling algorithms support a wide range of refinement operations to express feedback. However, these systems’ interactions are primarily driven by algorithmic convenience, ignoring users who may lack expertise in topic modeling. To better understand how non-expert users understand, assess, and refine topics, we conducted two user studies—an in-person interview study and an online crowdsourced study. These studies demonstrate a disconnect between what non-expert users want and the complex, low-level operations that current interactive systems support. In particular, our findings include: (1) analysis of how non-expert users perceive topic models; (2) characterization of primary refinement operations expected by non-expert users and ordered by relative preference; (3) further evidence of the benefits of supporting users in directly refining a topic model; (4) design implications for future human-in-the-loop topic modeling interfaces.

abstract={Context. Several empirical studies have explored the benefits of software design patterns, but their collective results are highly inconsistent. Resolving the inconsistencies requires investigating moderators—i.e., variables that cause an effect to differ across contexts. Objectives. Replicate a design patterns experiment at multiple sites and identify sufficient moderators to generalize the results across prior studies. Methods. We perform a close replication of an experiment investigating the impact (in terms of time and quality) of design patterns (Decorator and Abstract Factory) on software maintenance. The experiment was replicated once previously, with divergent results. We execute our replication at four universities—spanning two continents and three countries—using a new method for performing distributed replications based on closely coordinated, small-scale instances (“joint replication”). We perform two analyses: 1) a post-hoc analysis of moderators, based on frequentist and Bayesian statistics; 2) an a priori analysis of the original hypotheses, based on frequentist statistics. Results. The main effect differs across the previous instances of the experiment and across the sites in our distributed replication. Our analysis of moderators (including developer experience and pattern knowledge) resolves the differences sufficiently to allow for cross-context (and cross-study) conclusions. The final conclusions represent 126 participants from five universities and 12 software companies, spanning two continents and at least four countries. Conclusions. The Decorator pattern is found to be preferable to a simpler solution during maintenance, as long as the developer has at least some prior knowledge of the pattern. For A- stract Factory, the simpler solution is found to be mostly equivalent to the pattern solution. Abstract Factory is shown to require a higher level of knowledge and/or experience than Decorator for the pattern to be beneficial.},

abstract="Machine assistance is vital to managing the cost of corpus annotation projects. Identifying effective forms of machine assistance through principled evaluation is particularly important and challenging in under-resourced domains and highly heterogeneous corpora, as the quality of machine assistance varies. We perform a fine-grained evaluation of two machine-assistance techniques in the context of an under-resourced corpus annotation project. This evaluation requires a carefully controlled user study crafted to test a number of specific hypotheses. We show that human annotators performing morphological analysis of text in a Semitic language perform their task significantly more accurately and quickly when even mediocre pre-annotations are provided. When pre-annotations are at least 70 {\%} accurate, annotator speed and accuracy show statistically significant relative improvements of 25--35 and 5--7 {\%}, respectively. However, controlled user studies are too costly to be suitable for under-resourced corpus annotation projects. Thus, we also present an alternative analysis methodology that models the data as a combination of latent variables in a Bayesian framework. We show that modeling the effects of interesting confounding factors can generate useful insights. In particular, correction propagation appears to be most effective for our task when implemented with minimal user involvement. More importantly, by explicitly accounting for confounding variables, this approach has the potential to yield fine-grained evaluations using data collected in a natural environment outside of costly controlled user studies.",

Because No Free Lunch theorems dictate that no optimization algorithm can be considered more efficient than any other when considering all possible functions, the desired function class plays a prominent role in the model. In particular, this provides a direct way to answer the traditionally difficult question of what algorithm is best matched to a particular class of functions. Among the benefits of the model are the ability to specify the function class in a straightforward manner, a natural way to specify noisy or dynamic functions, and a new source of insight into No Free Lunch theorems for optimization. }

    abstract = { The focus of this paper is the application of Bayesian concepts to database query optimization. In relational database systems users retrieve data by describing the desired data. The description of the desired data takes the form of statements which specify operations on “relations” (as defined by set theory). In a relational database system a “query optimizer” determines how the desired data is to be found. The optimizer may have access to several potential algorithms for each step in the query. Each algorithm has a unique effect on the cost of evaluating the query. No single algorithm is best in all cases. To choose among the possible alternatives, the optimizer uses summary statistics of the data stored in the database to estimate the cost associated with the use of each alternative algorithm. Given the summary nature of the statistics typically collected, the true cost of the use of a given algorithm can be only estimated. As such, the query optimizer must choose algorithms in the presence of uncertainty. As will be illustrated later with a simple model, cases exist where the expected improvement in decision quality more than offsets the cost of sampling the database to gathering additional, more accurate, information. These cases are identified before such sampling is performed by using Bayesian pre-posterier analysis. When sample information is expected to have significant net value to the decision making process, sampling should be performed. In database query optimization readily available summary information is sufficient for the decision making process in some cases, in other cases, it is wholly inadequate. Examples of each of these cases will be identified. INFORMS Journal on Computing, ISSN 1091-9856, was published as ORSA Journal on Computing from 1989 to 1995 under ISSN 0899-1499. }

  abstract  = {Mrs is a lightweight Python-based MapReduce implementation designed to make MapReduce programs easy to write and quick to run, particularly useful for research and academia. A common set of algorithms that would benefit from Mrs are iterative algorithms, like those frequently found in machine learning; however, iterative algorithms typically perform poorly in the MapReduce framework, meaning potentially poor performance in Mrs as well. Therefore, we propose four modifications to the original Mrs with the intent to improve its ability to perform iterative algorithms. First, we used direct task-to-task communication for most iterations and only occasionally write to a distributed file system to preserve fault tolerance. Second, we combine the reduce and map tasks which span successive iterations to eliminate unnecessary communication and scheduling latency. Third, we propose a generator-callback programming model to allow for greater flexibility in the scheduling of tasks. Finally, some iterative algorithms are naturally expressed in terms of asynchronous message passing, so we propose a fully asynchronous variant of MapReduce. We then demonstrate Mrs' enhanced performance in the context of two iterative applications: particle swarm optimization (PSO), and expectation maximization (EM).}

By using a homotopy class or classes to represent one or more topological requirements, we build a framework that helps a robot understand a human's intent. This paper reviews a homotopic decomposition method that is used to convert any path into a string, which allows homotopic path equivalence to be performed by comparing strings. We then integrate the Homotopic Distributed Correspondence Graph (HoDCG) to infer the homotopic constraint in the format of strings from a language instruction. Finally, we use a homotopic path-planning algorithm that finds the optimal paths for a given objective and homotopic constraint. Experiment results show how a language instruction is converted into a path driven by an implicit topological requirement.}

Recent work in interactive topic modeling looks to
incorporate the user into the inference loop, for
example, by allowing them to view a model then
update it by specifying important words and words that
should be ignored. However, the majority of interactive
topic modeling work has been performed without fully
understanding the needs of the end user and does not
adequately consider challenges that arise in interactive
machine learning. In this paper, we outline a subset of
interactive machine learning design challenges with
specific considerations for interactive topic modeling.
For each challenge, we propose solutions based on
prior work and our own preliminary findings and
identify open questions to guide future work.}

  abstract  = {We present a method for fabricating prototypes of interactive computing devices from clay sculptures without requiring the designer to be skilled in CAD software. The method creates a "what you sculpt is what you get" process that mimics the "what you see is what you get" processes used in interface design for 2D screens. Our approach uses clay for modeling the basic shape of the device around 3D printed representations, which we call "blanks", of physical interaction widgets such as buttons, sliders, knobs and other electronics. Each blank includes 4 fiducial markers uniquely arranged on a visible surface. After scanning the sculpture, these fiducial marks allow our software to identify widget types and locations in the scanned model. The software then converts the scan into a printable prototype by positioning mounting surfaces, openings for the controls and a splitting plane for assembly. Because the blanks fit in the sculpted shape, they will reliably fit in the interactive prototype. Creating an interactive prototype requires about 30 minutes of human effort for sculpting, and after scanning, involves a single button click to use the process.}

  abstract  = {An important problem in human-robot interaction is for a human to be able to tell the robot go to a particular location with instructions on how to get there or what to avoid on the way. This paper provides a solution to problems where the human wants the robot not only to optimize some objective but also to honor “soft” or “hard” topological constraints, i.e. “go quickly from A to B while avoiding C”. The paper presents the HARRT* (homotopy-aware RRT*) algorithm, which is a computationally scalable algorithm that a robot can use to plan optimal paths subject to the information provided by the human. The paper provides a theoretic justification for the key property of the algorithm, proposes a heuristic for RRT*, and uses a set of simulation case studies of the resulting algorithm to make a case for why these properties are compatible with the requirements of human-robot interactive path-planning.}

  author={Clement, Mark J and Crandall, Keith A and Seppi, Kevin D and Snell, Quinn O},
  year={2004},
  publisher={Biotechnology and Bioinformatics Symposium(BIOT)},
  abstract = { When a new epidemic strikes, it is often important to determine the relationship between the current organism and others that have been successfully treated previously. The phylogenetic analysis problem generates the most likely family tree for a group of organisms based on DNA sequence data. This process can take a prohibitively long period of time with current algorithms. If trees resulting from prior searches are used to seed the search, correct trees can be found much more quickly. This jumpstarting algorithm can generate superior phylogenetic solutions much more quickly than existing algorithms. }
