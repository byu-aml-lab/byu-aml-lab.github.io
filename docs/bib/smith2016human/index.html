   abstract={Statistical topic modeling is a common tool for
summarizing the themes in a document corpus. Due to
the complexity of topic modeling algorithms, however, their results are not accessible to non-expert users.
Recent work in interactive topic modeling looks to
incorporate the user into the inference loop, for
example, by allowing them to view a model then
update it by specifying important words and words that
should be ignored. However, the majority of interactive
topic modeling work has been performed without fully
understanding the needs of the end user and does not
adequately consider challenges that arise in interactive
machine learning. In this paper, we outline a subset of
interactive machine learning design challenges with
specific considerations for interactive topic modeling.
For each challenge, we propose solutions based on
prior work and our own preliminary findings and
identify open questions to guide future work.},
