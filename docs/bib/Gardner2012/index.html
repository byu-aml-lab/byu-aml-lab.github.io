   abstract={Particle swarm optimization (PSO) has previously been parallelized primarily by distributing the computation corresponding to particles across multiple processors. In these approaches, the only benefit of additional processors is an increased swarm size. However, in many cases this is not efficient when scaled to very large swarm sizes (on very large clusters). Current methods cannot answer well the question: ``How can 1000 processors be fully utilized when 50 or 100 particles is the most efficient swarm size?&rdquo; In this paper we attempt to answer that question with a speculative approach to the parallelization of PSO that we refer to as SEPSO.},
