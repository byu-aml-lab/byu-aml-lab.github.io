   abstract={Effective text classification requires experts
to annotate data with labels; these training
data are time-consuming and expensive to
obtain. If you know what labels you want, active learning can reduce the number of
labeled documents needed. However, establishing
the label set remains difficult. Annotators
often lack the global knowledge
needed to induce a label set. We introduce
ALTO: Active Learning with Topic
Overviews, an interactive system to help
humans annotate documents: topic models
provide a global overview of what labels
to create and active learning directs
them to the right documents to label. Our
forty-annotator user study shows that while
active learning alone is best in extremely
resource limited conditions, topic models
(even by themselves) lead to better label
sets, and ALTOâ€™s combination is best overall.},
