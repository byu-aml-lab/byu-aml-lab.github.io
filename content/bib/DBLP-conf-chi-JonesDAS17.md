   abstract={Interactive computing has impacted how people experience outdoor recreation. Nevertheless, the role of interactive computing in outdoor recreation can be complicated. Some people engage in outdoor recreation precisely to avoid distractions associated with pervasive interactive computing. Others use interactive computing to create, enhance or share outdoor recreation experiences. In this SIG, participants will discuss research questions and foundational theories that might guide future work related to interactive computing in outdoor recreation. The discussion will range from engineering issues to research methods. Attendees will have opportunities to stay connected after the SIG.},
